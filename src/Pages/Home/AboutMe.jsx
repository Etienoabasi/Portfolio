          Hi! I'm Etienoabasi, a frontend developer with a growing passion for creating clean, responsive, and user-focused web experiences. I specialize in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and I'm currently expanding my skills in React.js to build more dynamic and interactive interfaces
          I enjoy learning by doing building projects, debugging real problems, and seeing how small design choices can improve user experience. Whether I'm working on a portfolio site or contributing to a team project, I bring attention to detail, a strong work ethic, and a deep desire to grow in this field.
        </p>
        <p className="hero--section-description">
           I'm actively looking for internship opportunities where I can contribute, collaborate, and gain hands-on experience from experienced developers.
